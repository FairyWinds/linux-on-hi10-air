### Introduction
This is my attempt to gather all the information in one place on how to support the [Chuwi Hi10 Pro](http://en.chuwi.com/product/items/Chuwi-Hi10-Pro.html) tablet on Linux.

The configuration will be around my distribution ([Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)), but I hope that all the instructions here can be easily adapted to other distributions. Be aware that Arch Linux it's a [rolling realese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release) distribution, so all software used will be pretty recent.

**Note:** This list is sorted by my own priorities.

### To do
 - Check [this patch](https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/397958/) for the light sensor.
 - Search for ways to improve WiFi stability (BIOS?).
 - Investigate the touch screen home button.

### Notes
 Take also a look to the [willyneutron](https://github.com/willyneutron/lubuntu_in_chuwi_Hi10Pro) repo, which is more detailed!
